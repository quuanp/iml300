[Backseat Exchange](https://quuanp.github.io/iml300/project-1/index.html) is a non-liner, interactive web experience that utilizes prose to convey a narrative.

### Description

Backseat Exchange is a intimate narrative about my childhood experiences and qualms. It is centered around the first time I came out to my friends in the backseat of their, and expands on the idea of lost intimacy. It reads like a stream of consciousness, without a formal structure or trajectory. I touch on themes of sexuality, familial dynamics, youthfulness, and memory. The moving images behind the text are gifs from films that heavily remind of the feelings conveyed in the text. The way the project is presented is fairy simple, and straightforward. The text is always centered and the viewer is forced to slowly click their way through, reading every line of text. I wanted to focus on the writing here, and give myself the platform to expand on my creative writing skills and the space to talk about the feelings that I often leave alone. There is no conclusion, ending, or climax that is present within this project, as to emulate the fact that my feelings are still very much in the air.
